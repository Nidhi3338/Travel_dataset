# Travel_Dataset // Data_Engineering project
The travel dataset provides detailed information on various trips taken by travelers, including their destination, travel dates, duration of the trip in days, traveler demographics (name, age, gender, and nationality), as well as the type and cost of accommodation and transportation. This dataset can be used to gain insights into travel patterns, preferences, and behaviors of different types of travelers. It can also be helpful for travel-related businesses, such as travel agencies, to create tailored marketing strategies and travel packages that meet the needs and preferences of different travelers.
